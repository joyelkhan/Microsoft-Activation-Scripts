### üì• **Download & Usage**

#### Method 1 - PowerShell (Windows 8 and later) ‚ù§Ô∏è
1. Open **PowerShell** (Not CMD). To do this, right-click the Windows start menu and select **PowerShell** or **Terminal**.
2. Copy and paste the following command into PowerShell and press **Enter**:
   ```powershell
   irm https://get.activated.win | iex
   ```

3. You'll see the activation options. 
   - Choose `[1]` for **HWID** to activate **Windows**.
   - Choose `[2]` for **Ohook** to activate **Office**.

And that's it! You're done!

#### Method 2 - Traditional (Windows 7 and later)
Alternatively, you can use the older method (though it may be deprecated soon):
```powershell
irm https://massgrave.dev/get | iex
```

**Note**: The `get.activated.win` URL might be blocked by some DNS services due to its newness.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**
- The **IRM** command in PowerShell downloads a script from the provided URL, and the **IEX** command executes it.
- Always verify the URL before executing the command and ensure you're downloading from a trusted source.
- Be cautious of **malware** disguised as MAS scripts using modified URLs.
